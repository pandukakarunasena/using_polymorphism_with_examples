# using_polymorphism_with_examples
In this example a use case of _inheritance_ and _polymorphism_ are
shown.

This simple console output project is built to check
the water level of a tank and notify the alarms, displays, 
and to the responsible parties via a text message and also
opening the flood gates when water level hits a certain value.

_WithoutPolymorphism_ and _UsingPolymorphism_ classes show the difference in 
between using object-oriented concepts to make flexible, maintainable, re-usable code bases.

_WithoutPolymorphism_ class has several issues such as every time we need to add an equipment or 
remove the class code should be changed accordingly.

_UsingPolymorphism_ class overcome those methods by inheriting with the same interface and having the
same _update()_ method in all the equipment. you can understand it better by referring the two code files.
