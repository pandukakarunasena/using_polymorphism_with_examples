# using_polymorphism_with_examples
In this example a use case of _inheritance_ and _polymorphism_ are
shown.

This simple console output project is built to check
the water level of a tank and notify the alarms, displays, 
and to the responsible parties via a text message and also
opening the flood gates when water level hits a certain value.

_Without_polymorphism_ and _Using_polymorphism_ classes show the difference in 
between using object-oriented concepts to make flexible, maintainable, re-usable code bases.
